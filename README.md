# VPN Integration Project

## Description
This project is focused on creating a robust Virtual Private Network (VPN) integration system. It's designed using C programming language and is comprised of several components that handle different aspects of a VPN service. The code facilitates secure and efficient management of network traffic, ensuring privacy and integrity of data.

## Contents
1. `integration_vpn.c`: This is the core file that integrates various VPN functionalities. It likely includes the main function that ties together the components of the VPN service.
2. `tcp.c`: Dedicated to handling TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) connections, this file is essential for establishing and maintaining reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data over the network.
3. `vnic.c`: Stands for Virtual Network Interface Controller. This file is responsible for managing virtual network interfaces, which are crucial for routing data through the VPN.
4. `vpn.h`: A header file that defines common constants, structures, and function prototypes used across the project. It ensures consistency and modularity in the codebase.

## Installation/Usage Instructions

### Requirements
- A C compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)
- Development libraries for network programming (like `libssl` for encryption, if used)

### Compilation
To compile the project, navigate to the directory containing the files and run the following command:

```bash
gcc -o vpn_program integration_vpn.c tcp.c vnic.c -l[any additional libraries]
```

Replace `[any additional libraries]` with the names of any libraries your code depends on.

### Execution
Run the compiled program as a server using:

```bash
./vpn_program --server
```
And run the compiled program as a client using:

```bash
./vpn_program 
```
